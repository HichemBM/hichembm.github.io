            <h1>About me</h1>

            <p>I’m really into building IT setups that are not only super efficient but also secure. It’s about making sure the technology genuinely helps the business run smoother and grow. I get a kick out of looking at existing systems, figuring out what’s not working quite right, and then putting in place solid procedures and tools. Getting Google Workspace running like clockwork, sorting out mobile device management, keeping SaaS in check, and automating the boring bits are examples of initiatives that drive me.</p>

<p>For me, smooth IT operations are the backbone of any successful company. I tend to focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Making sure everything runs smoothly</strong>: setting up and fine-tuning IT processes so things are consistent, we don’t get bogged down with manual tasks, and the IT support is top-notch.</li>
  <li><strong>Picking the right tools for the job</strong>: I’m all about using the right tech (like JAMF Pro for managing Macs, <a href="https://www.bettercloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BetterCloud</a> to keep an eye on SaaS apps, or 1Password to lock down passwords) to tackle problems and make things better.</li>
  <li><strong>Being smart with money</strong>: I’m pretty careful with IT budgets and always on the lookout for ways to save a bit without cutting corners on quality or security, like ditching Dropbox for Google Drive if it makes more sense.</li>
  <li><strong>Making sure everyone’s happy and productive</strong>: I want people to have the tools and help they need, which sometimes means building things myself, like automated bots for Slack.</li>
</ul>

<p>My career has pretty much been about making IT work better. At <a href="https://jellysmack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jellysmack</a>, as IT Director, a big part was making sure vendor management was spot on and setting up IT support when things were changing fast. I’ve spent a ton of time diving deep into Google Workspace, using <a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAM</a> a lot to get things done quickly for loads of users at places like <a href="https://fr.getaround.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getaround</a>, <a href="https://alan.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alan</a>, <a href="http://qonto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Qonto</a>, and Drivy.</p>

<p>At Drivy, I got 1Password for Teams up and running to make password management easier, and put JAMF Pro in place to keep the Macs in check. I even built comprehensive onboarding and offboarding workflows to automate the User Lifecycle Management. When Getaround and Drivy merged, I was using <a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GAM</a> intensively to merge the Google Workspace instances. At <a href="https://fr.getaround.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getaround</a>, I’ve revamped the Network Infrastructure in the Paris HQ, and even back at <a href="https://buzzman.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzman</a>, it was all about getting Google Workspace set up right.</p>

<p>You can see more of the projects where I’ve been focusing on making things more efficient in the <a href="/projects/">Projects section</a>.</p>

<p>I believe in staying at the forefront of technology, which involves a commitment to ongoing learning. To that end, I’ve recently achieved my <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/12f6f183-f3e1-4fe1-b905-b5803b7d5433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JAMF 100 certification</a> and am in the process of completing <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learner/hichem-bm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google specializations</a> in IT Automation with Python and Project Management. My next goal is the Google Workspace certification.</p>

<p>This continuous development is complemented by personal projects where I explore new technologies, often incorporating AI to discover innovative solutions. For example, I’ve built a flashcard-like website that helped train for my JAMF 100 certification.</p>

<p>It’s this appetite for continuous learning and progress that I bring to every challenge.</p>
