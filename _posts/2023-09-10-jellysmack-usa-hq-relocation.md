Establishing the New Los Angeles Tech Hub

**Situation:** Jellysmack, a company focused on empowering online content creators[cite: 220], decided to establish a new USA headquarters in Los Angeles, specifically at the Pacific Design Center[cite: 133]. As IT Director, I joined during a period of company restructuring[cite: 222].

**Task:** I was responsible for supervising all IT aspects of this significant office relocation and setup[cite: 133]. This included designing the IT infrastructure for the new space, managing vendors, ensuring connectivity, and coordinating the technology needs for the employees moving into the new HQ.

**Action:**
My responsibilities encompassed:
1.  **Infrastructure Design & Planning:** Collaborated with facilities and architects to plan network cabling, server room requirements (if any, or cloud-first approach), Wi-Fi coverage, and AV setups for meeting rooms.
2.  **Vendor Management:** Sourced and managed vendors for internet service provision, network hardware installation, and AV equipment.
3.  **Procurement & Asset Management:** Oversaw the procurement of new IT equipment (laptops, monitors, peripherals) as needed and managed the inventory for the new location.
4.  **Network & Systems Setup:** Configured and deployed network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls, access points) and ensured seamless integration with existing Jellysmack corporate systems and security protocols.
5.  **On-site Support & Go-Live:** Coordinated with any local IT support (even if it was a new hire like Taurean mentioned in another context [cite: 221, 224]) to manage the final setup and provide on-site support during the initial move-in phase, ensuring a smooth transition for employees.
6.  **Budget Oversight:** Managed the IT budget allocated for the relocation project.

**Result:**
The new Jellysmack USA HQ in Los Angeles was successfully launched from an IT perspective, providing a robust and modern technological environment for employees. The infrastructure was designed to support current needs and future growth, ensuring reliable connectivity and access to all necessary corporate resources from day one. This project was crucial in establishing a key operational hub for the company in the US.
