*Enhancing IT Asset Visibility and Control*

**Situation:** As Qonto, a company in the banking industry[cite: 146], experienced rapid growth, managing the expanding inventory of IT assets (laptops, mobile devices, peripherals) became increasingly complex. A robust and centralized asset management system was needed for tracking, maintenance, and compliance.

**Task:** The goal was to implement an IT inventory tool to improve asset tracking, lifecycle management, and provide accurate data for financial reporting and security audits. Reftab was identified as the tool to be used. [cite: 152]

**Action:**
1.  **Needs Assessment:** Worked with IT, Finance, and Security teams to define the requirements for the asset management system, including data points to track, reporting needs, and integration capabilities.
2.  **Reftab Configuration:** Spearheaded the configuration and customization of the Reftab platform to align with Qonto's specific asset types, locations, and workflows.
3.  **Data Migration:** Oversaw the process of populating Reftab with existing asset data, ensuring accuracy and completeness. This may have involved manual entry, spreadsheet imports, or integration with other systems if possible.
4.  **Process Integration:** Integrated Reftab into IT operational processes, including employee onboarding (asset assignment), offboarding (asset retrieval), repairs, and disposal.
5.  **Team Training:** Trained the IT team on using Reftab for daily asset management tasks.
6.  **Reporting Setup:** Established reporting mechanisms within Reftab to provide insights into asset distribution, aging, and status for compliance and financial purposes.

**Result:**
The implementation of Reftab provided Qonto with a centralized and accurate IT asset inventory. This led to improved efficiency in tracking and managing assets, better control over the asset lifecycle, reduced risk of loss or theft, and streamlined processes for audits and financial reporting. It also supported the high-security requirements of a banking industry company by ensuring all IT assets were accounted for. [cite: 146, 152]
