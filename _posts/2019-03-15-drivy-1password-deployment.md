This project is an example of proactive IT management and adaptability, where an immediate team-level need was leveraged to address a larger, more strategic business objective: enhancing the company's overall security posture.

The initiative began when the [EPDD (Engineering, Product, Data, and Design) teams](https://getaround.tech/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} at [Drivy](https://getaround.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} needed a replacement for a credential-sharing tool that was being discontinued. My IT roadmap had already identified the need for a company-wide password manager, so I expanded the project's scope to meet this larger goal. After a formal RFP process and vendor evaluation, [1Password for Teams](https://1password.com/business-security){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} was selected as the optimal solution.

I managed the full project lifecycle over a three-month period, structured in three main phases:
1. the technical deployment and integration,
2. a phased user onboarding and training program for over 130 employees across Europe, and
3. the development of comprehensive documentation for long-term sustainability.

Key success factors included close alignment with stakeholder requirements from the outset and a carefully planned, phased rollout that prioritized the highest-need teams first.

The project not only met its technical goals but also delivered significant cultural and security-related outcomes. It fostered a company-wide culture of security awareness, with users demonstrating a clear commitment to stronger security practices.

A notable metric of success was that approximately 65% of employees adopted the tool for personal use, indicating high user satisfaction and trust.

This initiative successfully established 1Password as a fundamental and valued component of Drivy's Information System.
