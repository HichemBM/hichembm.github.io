Streamlining Collaboration and Administration

**Situation:** At Buzzman, an advertising agency with approximately 80-100 users, Google Workspace (then Google Apps for Work) was the core platform for email, document collaboration, and communication (Gmail, Drive, Hangouts)[cite: 136]. While functional, there were opportunities to optimize its administration and ensure best practices were followed.

**Task:** My objective was to streamline the management of the Google Workspace instance, improve operational efficiency for user onboarding/offboarding, and ensure the platform was being utilized effectively and securely according to company needs.

**Action:**
1.  **Admin Review:** Conducted a thorough review of the existing Google Workspace setup, including user accounts, groups, Drive sharing permissions, and security settings.
2.  **Process Refinement:** Standardized processes for user provisioning, de-provisioning, and group management to ensure consistency and security.
3.  **Feature Utilization:** Promoted the effective use of core features like shared Drives (Team Drives), Calendar resources, and Google Meet for efficient collaboration.
4.  **Security Best Practices:** Implemented or reinforced security best practices, such as encouraging 2-Step Verification adoption and reviewing third-party app access.
5.  **Support & Troubleshooting:** Acted as the primary point of contact for Google Workspace related support issues, resolving user queries and technical problems.
6.  **Exploration of Automation (Conceptual for Buzzman, implemented later elsewhere):** While at Buzzman, the scale might not have demanded complex automation, the experience here [cite: 136] laid the groundwork for later leveraging tools like GAM for batch operations [cite: 140, 143, 145, 148] and custom app development for onboarding (as done at Drivy [cite: 137, 138, 139]).

**Result:**
The focused management of Google Workspace at Buzzman led to more efficient IT operations, particularly around user lifecycle management. Employees had reliable access to essential collaboration tools, and foundational security practices were maintained, ensuring a stable platform for the agency's creative work. This hands-on experience with a smaller instance provided valuable insights for managing larger, more complex Google Workspace environments in subsequent roles.
