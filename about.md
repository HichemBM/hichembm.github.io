Hello World, I'm Hichem (HEE-shem).

For over a decade, I've been immersed in the world of Information Technology, but my core belief has always been simple:\
**technology should be an invisible enabler of a company's success, not a roadblock.**

My goal is to build IT environments where teams feel empowered and productive, and where systems are so reliable and intuitive that people can focus on their best work without ever having to think about the tools.

### My Professional Journey

My career has been shaped by the unique challenges of high-growth startups and scale-ups. I started my journey at **Drivy**, where I learned firsthand how to scale IT operations to support a team that was doubling in size. It was there I discovered the importance of robust security protocols, leading the deployment of 1Password and managing my first critical incidents.

That experience was the perfect foundation for the strategic challenge that came next: leading the post-acquisition IT integration of Drivy into **Getaround**. Merging two international companies was more than a technical project; it was about **uniting two cultures into a single**, cohesive digital identity. It required meticulous planning, clear communication, and a deep understanding of culture and compliance frameworks.

From there, I've had the privilege of leading teams and building processes at some of Europe's most exciting tech companies, including **Qonto**, **Alan**, and **Jellysmack**. Each role has reinforced my belief in a hands-on, proactive approach—whether it was implementing an asset management system from the ground up, automating the entire employee onboarding process, or managing the IT logistics for a new international headquarters.

### Beyond the Keyboard

My passion for building and optimizing systems doesn't stop when I log off. At home, you'll often find me working on my homelab—a custom-built server for media, backups, and experimentation—or finding new ways to automate my smart home. This love for hands-on tech even extends to projects like building a smart mirror with a Raspberry Pi.

When I'm not tinkering with hardware, I'm probably deep into a strategy game like *Civilization*, which satisfies my love for long-term planning. And when it's time to truly disconnect, my go-to is the water. Whether it's swimming or exploring the sea, it's the perfect way for me to clear my head and recharge.

I'm always open to discussing new challenges in tech leadership and process optimization. If my approach to technology leadership resonates with you, I'd be very pleased to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hichem-bm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connect</a>.
