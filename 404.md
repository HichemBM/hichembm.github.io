  <h2>Oops! Page Not Found</h2>

  <p>
    We're sorry, but the page you were looking for couldn't be found. 
    It might have been moved, deleted, or perhaps the URL was mistyped.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can try returning to the <a href="{{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">homepage</a> or use the navigation to find what you're looking for.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
    <a href="{{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="btn btn-primary">Go to Homepage</a>
  </p>

</div>
